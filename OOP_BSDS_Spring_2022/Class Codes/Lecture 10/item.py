#define class to represent Item, where each item has three members. First member is code (string value like A24).
#Second data member is price and third data member is quantity. Keep data members private. Write following member
#functions:
#initializer function to initialize data member with 3 parameters provided in the function
#3 setter functions, for each data member write separate set function
#write 3 getter functions, to get value of data members
#write show function, to show value of three data members in a single line
#write compare function, compare function will return 1 if price of first item is greater than price of second
#iterm, return -1 if price of first item is smaller than price of second item, otherwise return zero
